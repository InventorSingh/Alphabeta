# Alphabeta Website

Hello Everyone, this is our playgound website where we learn programming and social media.


# What we have so far! 

- An Astro website which can be deployed on Cloudflare.
- SVG vector graphics in assets. 
    - These are important to build our brand Identity.
    - We will use these as AI knowledge base to make bots to build our Social Media posts.
